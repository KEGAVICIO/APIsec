Attack Vector Description
  "Attackers take advantage of lack of logging and monitoring to abuse systems without being noticed"

Security Weakness Description 
  "Without logging and monitoring, or with insufficient logging and monitoring, it is almost impossible to track suspicious activities and respond to them in a timely fashion"

Impacts Description
  "Without visibility over ongoing malicious activities, attackers have plenty of time to fully compromise systems"

Summary 
  - Logs reveal patterns in API usage, can also identity abuse
  - Logs provide audit trail of activities
  - Often required for compliance purposes Ensure logs cannot be altered by attackers
  - Monitoring helps detect suspicious activities, anomalous behavior

OWASP Preventative Measures
  - Log failed authentication, denied access, input validation errors
  - Write logs for a log management solution, include detail to identify malicious actor
  - Logs should be handled as sensitive data
  - COntinuously monitor infrastructure, network, API functioning
  - Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  - Configure custom alerts to detect suspicious activities earlier
