Attack VEctor Description
  "Exploiting this issue requires attackers to identify and potentially compromise other APIs/services the target API integrated with. Usually this information is not publicly acailable or the integrated API/service is not easily exploitable."

Security Weakness Description
  "Developers tend to trust and not verify the endpoints that interact with external or third-party APIs, relying on weaker security requirements such as those regarding transport security, authentication/authorization and input validation and sanitization. Attackers need to identify services the target API integrates with (data sources) and, eventually, compromise them"

Summary
  - Most of API top 10 focuses on API provider
  - APIs often path of least resistance
  - If attacker compromises 3rd party API, then other businesses at risk
  - If API uses unencrypted connection then data exposed in clear text
  - 3rd party APIs may have less stringent security standards
  - Could also be vulnerable to injection, authorization, other attacks 

OWASP Preventative Measures
  - Assess API security of service providers
  - Ensure all API is encrypted
  - Always validate, sanitize data received 3rd party APIs 
  - Do not blindly follow redirects
