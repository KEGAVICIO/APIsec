Unrestricted Resource Consumption
 - Formerly "Lack of Resources and Rate Limiting" (OWASP 2019) 

Attack Vector Description
  - Exploited via simple API request
  - Multiple request from single source, or across clouds
  - Automated tools simulate DoS via high traffic loads

Security Weakness Description
  - APIs commonly do not limit interactions or resource limits
  - Test for resource consumption weakness via:
    - API requests that specify resource quantities
    - Analyzing response status/time/length
  - Also valid for batched operations
  - Evaluate cost impact based on service provider pricing

Impacts Description 
  - Exploitation can lead to Denial of service
  - Economic impact due to higher infrastructure demands

Sources of Vulnerability
  Missing/inappropriate setting:
    - Execution timeouts
    - Max allocable memory
    - Max number of file description 
    - Max number of processes
    - Max upload file size
    - # of operations in single request 
    - # of records in single request
    - 3rd party provider's spend limit 

Summary 
  - Every API request has technical & financial cost
  - Lack of rate controls increase risk of:
    - Denial of service 
    - Unnecessary financial cost
    - Degradation of service to users

OWASP Preventative Measures
  - Docker offers controls for memory, CPU, restarts, file descriptors, processes
  - LImit number of API calls within timeframe
  - Notify client when limit is exceeded
  - Add server-side validation for inputs
  - Define, enforce max size for inputs & paylods
